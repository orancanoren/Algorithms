# Algorithms
<h4>Efficient C++ implementations of all sorts of algorithms</h4>

Here I share generic implementations of the algorithms I've studied. Since I am studying OpenMP, the challenge here is to build multithreaded implementations of the suitible algorithms.

<strong>Note:</strong> This is a new repo, thus it lacks the content right now. It will be complete in 1-2 weeks.
