<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p>Compilation Notes</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the code utilizes C++11 features, please ensure
that your compiler supports such functionality</li>
<li>Graph Theory source uses a templated class structure. In your project,
place the graph.cpp in the same directory as graph.hpp and do NOT
include the CPP file in your project
</ul>
